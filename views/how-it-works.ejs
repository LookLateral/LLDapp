			<p>Art owners tag their artworks with the Look Lateral Signature Tags, then upload their works (along with the respective provenance information) to the immutable Look Lateral blockchain. 
			Owners then chose to make between 10% and 49% of each piece available for purchase on the platform, at which time buyers can use their LOOK tokens to purchase fractional ownership of those pieces. 
			Minimum purchase is $10 USD.</p>
			
			<p>After that initial purchase of fractional ownership, Members may buy and sell their fractional ownership in the Look Lateral marketplace. 
			The Look Lateral Coop is a membership-driven cooperative organization. Membership is required to participate in the platform. 
			Some restrictions apply, please see <a href="/termsofservice">Terms and Conditions</a> for more information.</p>
